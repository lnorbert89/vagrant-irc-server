# vagrant-irc-server

Automated Vagrant installer on VirtualBox Virtual Machine with Ubuntu LTS and running an InspIRCd service on it.

Edit the inspircd.conf file before you run this script.
If you change the default port in the inspircd.conf, be sure you changed the forwarded port in the Vagrantfile to the same.
